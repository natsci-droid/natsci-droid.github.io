## Introduction
Stack Overflow has surveyed over 60,000 people, providing the anonomised data for open analysis. Here we look at the different languages people use, including:
* whether it is common to use the same languages,
* if there is a difference in languages used by professionals and students
* if there is an impact on salary

## Language popularity
In terms of popularity, JavaScript is the most frequently reported language used, closely followed by HTML/CSS. Python ranks as third and C++ is the 10th most popular language used.

## Languages used together
Many respondants replied that they use multiple languages, so we next look at the correlation between each of the languages. The correlation matrix is dark blue where languages are rarely used together and closer to red when they are. Obviously a language is perfectly correlated with itself, hence the bright red diagonal. Here we find that users of JavaScrpt are also likely to use HTML/CSS, C++ programmers are likely to use C and Python programmers often use Bash/Shell/PowerShell. If you use one of these have you considered learning the other?

## Languages used by professionals vs students
There does seem to be a difference in languages used between professional developers and students, given a 75% classification accuracy using languages to predict the level of profession, so are you sure you're learning the right language for the job you want? There may be opportunities in switching language.

## Language impact on salary
Finally, there doesn't appear to be a strong link between coding language and salary, with only a regression score of 0.1, so if money is what you're looking for, it's not a strong factor in choosing which language to learn.
